I am doing these challenges to learn and practice, not to reinvent the wheel. My primary goal is to enhance my problem-solving skills and deepen my understanding of CSS. These challenges provide a great opportunity to experiment, research, and try out well-crafted solutions I find along the way.

Challenge #2: CSS only toggle button

Challenge #3: CSS only tooltip
